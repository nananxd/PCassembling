    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 4bbb7cc1ad3173b4e82cb72ecc34f27e, type: 3}
    description: 'is the primary circuit board in a computer, connecting essential
      components like the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals to enable communication
      and functionality. It also houses expansion slots, ports, and chipsets that
      support additional hardware, making it a crucial component in desktops, laptops,
      and servers.

  - modelName: 'Central Processing Unit (CPU) '
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 2015f6df3b9b4584fa6a28a63fd0e119, type: 3}
    description: also known as the processor, is the core component of a computer
      responsible for executing instructions from programs by performing arithmetic,
      logical, control, and input/output operations. Acting as the "brain" of the
      system, the CPU processes data, manages tasks, and ensures smooth operation
      by coordinating with other hardware components.
  - modelName: Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: dd4ab8fbc1f2d9448b6e2dc350001c01, type: 3}
    description: 'is the primary storage device in a computer, responsible for storing
      the operating system, software applications, and user data, including files,
      documents, and multimedia. Unlike volatile memory, an HDD retains data permanently
      until modified or deleted, using spinning magnetic disks to read and write
      information.

  - modelName: 'Optical Disk Drive (ODD) '
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: be06fd06b9e0f6044b186fa4630b0877, type: 3}
    description: 's a hardware component that reads and writes data from optical
      discs such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs using laser technology. It allows
      users to install software, watch movies, listen to music, and back up data.

  - modelName: 'Power Supply Unit (PSU) '
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 1d6c28c1abeddb2418d03dfd8423b4c8, type: 3}
    description: 'is a crucial component that converts high-voltage alternating current
      (AC) from a wall outlet into lower-voltage direct current (DC) required by
      the motherboard, storage drives, and other hardware components. It ensures
      stable power distribution to prevent damage and supports efficient operation,
      with varying wattage capacities to meet different system requirements.

  - modelName: CPU fan
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: fb738a7bb37c71a47aa12fdc3f1138db, type: 3}
    description: 'is a vital cooling component that dissipates heat generated by
      the processor, preventing overheating and ensuring stable performance. It works
      by drawing heat away from the CPU heatsink and expelling it through airflow,
      helping to maintain optimal operating temperatures and prolong the lifespan
      of the processor.

'
  - modelName: Random Access Memory (RAM)
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 696b0dd2ce9f434408ddac79b4e2700e, type: 3}
    description: 'is a high-speed, volatile memory that temporarily stores data and
      instructions that the processor needs for immediate and upcoming tasks, allowing
      for quick access and efficient multitasking. Unlike hard drives or SSDs, which
      provide long-term storage, RAM enables significantly faster data retrieval,
      improving system performance and responsiveness.

  - modelName: 20/24-pin ATX Main Power Connector
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: cec7a3f72d63fcd4c991c5ca96d23265, type: 3}
    description: 'is the primary power interface between the power supply and the
      motherboard, providing essential voltage and current for system operation.
      Older systems use only the 20-pin configuration, while modern motherboards
      require all 24 pins; in such cases, the extra 4 pins can either detach or hang
      over the socket, depending on the PSU design.


'
  - modelName: ATX12V Power Connector
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: ed92a114fb1568f4c8011b163cac5e01, type: 3}
    description: 'plays a crucial role in supplying a dedicated and stable 12V power
      source to the CPU, ensuring it receives sufficient energy for processing tasks
      without fluctuations. This direct power delivery helps maintain system stability,
      prevents voltage drops, and supports optimal processor performance, especially
      in high-power computing environments.

'
  - modelName: Serial ATA Connectors
    modelVisual: {fileID: 21300000, guid: c31b74387460ea842a0dae0c7a9ac1d5, type: 3}
    description: 'identified by their 7-pin design, enable high-speed data transfer
      between the motherboard and SATA storage devices, such as hard drives and solid-state
      drives. These connectors use dedicated SATA cables to ensure efficient and
      reliable communication, supporting data rates of up to 3.0 Gb/s or 6.0 Gb/s
      for smooth system performance.
